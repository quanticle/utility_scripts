This is a collection of utility scripts that I use for system administration and
miscellaneous tasks


cd_rip.py
  This is a cd-ripping/encoding script. The motivation is because 1) CDDB
  entries for my music are often wrong and 2) I don't organize by track; I
  organize by artist and album. So the MP3 tagging utilites that do everything
  for me are way overkill. I just want to punch in the artist and album names
  and have the (properly tagged) MP3 and FLAC files dumped into the current
  directory so I can organize them however I wish.

  A secondary motivation is that there are a few disks that can only be properly
  ripped at low speeds. High speed reading causes skips and jitter beyond even
  CDParanoia's ability to fix. So the script includes an optional speed argument
  that allows you to throttle down the CD drive as necessary to achieve a clean
  read.

  Prerequisites:
    - cdparanoia (basic CD-ripping & error correction)
    - flac - lossless encoding
    - lame - MP3 encoding
    - mutagen - tag writing

  Usage: cd_rip.py <artist> <album> [optional read speed]

  This will probably be never ported to Windows, as CDParanoia is deeply
  entwined with Linux's CD/DVD drivers.

gapless_playback.sh
  This simple (4-lines!) shell script pipes mplayer into aplay using a FIFO and
  a 2-sec buffer, creating a simple gapless FLAC player.
